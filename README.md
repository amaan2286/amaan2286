# 👋 Hi, I'm Amaan!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm an engineering student with a passion for **embedded systems**, **power electronics**, and **practical simulations**. I love building things that bridge hardware with logic and also have a good hold in C++, C and HTML.

## ⚡ What I Do

🔌 **Embedded Systems Development**  
- Arduino-based projects: temperature sensors, ultrasonic robots, BLDC motor control  
- PWM signals, Hall sensors, and real-time motor feedback systems

🔋 **Power Electronics**  
- H-bridge circuits, wireless charging simulations  
- Battery management system basics using simulation tools

🛠 **Circuit Design & Simulation**  
- TinkerCad
- LTspice for waveform simulation  
- KiCad for schematic + PCB layout design

📈 **Programming & Data**  
- C/C++
- Python: NumPy, basic visualization (scatter graphs, etc.)  
- Working on integrating software logic into hardware workflows

☁️ **Cloud Basics**  
- Learning the ropes of Google Cloud and deployment environments
